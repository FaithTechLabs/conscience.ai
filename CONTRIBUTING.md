# Organization

This project will be organized with main repo (this one) hosting the high-level overviews of the philosophy of the project, guides on how to make practical decisions based on the philosophy, and other meta information about Conscience.AI. It will also include a listing and description of the applications based on the philosophy.

The meat of the project, the actual applications, will be hosted in separate repositories. 

As this project is in very early stages of development, releases will be fast and furious and you can expect many things to be broken along the way.

# How to Contribute

Your contributions in the following areas would be invaluable and highly appreciated:

## Developers

- Contribute to the individual applications by fixing bugs in open issues
- Look at the TODO list in the main repo or the application repos to find features that you can work on

## Users

- When you encounter issues with anything, whether it's code or unclear documentation, please submit an issue. We would appreciate as much detail as possible
- If you have suggestions for other applications or a use case that we should consider, we would love to hear it

## Anyone

- If you have questions or comments about the philosophy behind the project, please do not create an issue. Instead, you can join us on our Slack channel to have an open discussion about the choices behind the framework.

# Contributing Code

All contributions to an application must include a test to show that the bug is fixed or that the feature works. Once your local copy is working and the tests are passing, send a pull request so that it can be reviewed and tested by the maintainers. 

It is recommended to open an issue to discuss new feature development before writing the code for it, to ensure that the community is aligned with the need and fit of the new feature.
