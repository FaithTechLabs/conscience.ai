# Theoretical

- Write the guiding philosophy behind moral decisions
- Write a guide to practical decision making based on the philosophy

# Practical Applications

## Classify Mixed Content

- Input: text, images, websites, or social media profiles/pages
- Output: classification of maturity of the content: adult, nsfw, 13+, family

## Monetization

The monetization of Conscience.AI will be based on training the classification models, so the trained models and training data will be private. A pay-per-use API will be available for developers who want an easy implementation of the conscience.

``` $rating = Conscience::classifyMaturity($website_url);
